OVERVIEW

  Speaker notes are kept in comments to hide from presentation unless the comment is in a code chunk which will be in place to 
  keep a track of the code execution and purpose.
  
  Code requires you to have the csv data set that is available from the following GitHub repository: 
  https://github.com/Mauzey/MATH513-Group-Work.
  
  Extraction code and most of the cleaning/feature engineering code has been left in the GitHub and not embedded here as per 
  discussion with Luciana to avoid overwhelming the rMarkdown file.

<!--- SPEAKER NOTES - WILL

  Hi, today we will be discussing the result from the strategic analysis of Twitter data for Samsung and Apple. 

  Samsung and Apple were chosen as our competing businesses due to the recent release of their flagship phones, the S20FE and 
  iPhone12. This meant we would have access to sufficient relevant data on Twitter to perform analysis upon.

  We chose to gather some extra tweets relating to the S20 to give us some comparable information for sentiment analysis and to 
  determine if there was any improvement in sentiment from the S20 to the S20FE. 

  We utilised RStudio in combination with the 'rTweet' package to extract and analyse the data from the Twitter API.

  To allow us to work professionally and on various parts of the project at the same time as a group, we decided to break up the code into 
  sections and utilise GitHub to keep track of the project.

## Research

<!--- SPEAKER NOTES: - WILL
  
  Twitter provides its data through a number of APIs and after the Cambridge Analytica 'data breach', is one of the few social 
  media platforms that has not limited the data provided through it's API. (Ahemd, Dr. Wasim (2019))
  
  Twitter data can provide insights into the public's opinions and combined with the openness and the generous rate limiting,
  it can produce powerful results. (Young, Michelle (2017))

  We came to the conclusion that it was better to use hashtags instead of pulling data from profiles. This was to ensure we would 
  get a wide range of opinions for a fairer analysis of the public's sentiment.

  For our hashtags, we looked to the Samsung Mobile page and identified that the hashtags '#GalaxyS20' and '#GalaxyS20FE' were 
  the official hashtags used.
  
  We then looked for the same information from Apple but found that since the Twitter account was hacked in July, Apple have not 
  been keeping tweets on their Twitter page. (Swider, Matt (2020))
  
  We decided to look to the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, as he would most likely be using the official hashtag, as deemed by
  Apple's marketing team. This led us to the hashtag '#iPhone12'.

--->

<!--- EXTRA NOTES (Cut from speaker notes to save time):

  We performed some sample searches of other hashtags like S20 and S20FE using the advanced Twitter search, on the website, to 
  determine how relevant the hashtag was.
  
  We went through search results and examined the difference between the date of the latest tweet and the date of the 25th tweet 
  in the list. This identified whether a hashtag was being used by the public and this further supported our findings that the 
  hastags '#iPhone12', '#SamsungS20' and '#SamungS20FE' were the best to pull data.

--->

**Choosing Twitter for Analysis**

- Open API Access compared to others
- Almost all data is public
- Advanced filtering and queries
- Generous Rate limiting

**Determining Hashtags**

- @SamsungMobile <!-- [https://twitter.com/SamsungMobile](https://twitter.com/SamsungMobile)-->
  - #GalaxyS20FE and #GalaxyS20
- @apple <!--[https://twitter.com/Apple](https://twitter.com/Apple) -->
  - No information
- @tim_cook<!-- [https://twitter.com/tim_cook](https://twitter.com/tim_cook) -->
  - #iPhone12

## Time Periods for Data Collection

<!--- SPEAKER NOTES - Will

  The standard rtweet function allowed us to pull data from the last 6-9 days. We decided that just after the release date of the 
  phones would be the best time to examine the public's opinion.

  Due to the limitations of the standard search, we utilised the full archive premium feature to pull tweets relating to the S20, 
  seen here in turquoise. 
  
  However, there was a mistake that led to the tweets being pulled a little earlier than the release date, as seen by the turquoise 
  vertical line. 
  
  We learned from this, corrected our code and pulled as much data as we could for the other two phones using the premium 30 
  day function.
  
  The 30 day limitation meant that the tweets we pulled are about 3 weeks after the release date for the S20FE, seen in purple and 
  1 week after the iPhone seen in gold.
  
  From the graph, you can see that we managed to gather a reasonable amount of tweets and re-tweets over the month of November 
  for both these phones.

## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

<!--- SPEAKER NOTES - Alex

  Once the data had been collected, we cleaned it and engineered a selection of features to enable a more in-depth analysis.

  - We removed duplicate tweet and user observations. Duplicate tweets occurred due to overlapping data acquisition periods and 
  duplicate users because one user is able to post many tweets.
  
  - We started with 110,000 tweets and users, and were left with 74,000 tweets and 35,000 users after data cleaning

  - We then stripped the tweet text and user bios of:
    - Links
    - Hash-tags
    - Emojis
    - User mentions
  
  - Users were marked as potential bots based on:
    - Whether the source of their tweets identified them as a bot and whether the user's bio identified them as a bot
    - ...this was done using keywords
    
  - Tweets were marked as potential spam based on the their text, through the user of keywords, or whether the author of the 
    tweet had been previously marked as a bot

  - The raw user locations varied because twitter allows custom locations (such as 'on a mountain' or just 'earth'):
    - We used the 'country code' package to extract countries in order to make them usable in analysis and had 25% of tweets with a location that was usable.
  
  Due to issues with the data returned by the rtweet package:
  - We had to manually extract the hash-tags and features from each of the tweet's
    - These features were: The product's Display, Camera, Battery, Price, and 5G capabilities

--->

**Data Cleaning**

- Duplicate tweet and user observations were removed
- Tweet text and user bios were cleaned
  + Removed links, hash-tags, emojis, and user mentions

**Feature Engineering**

- Users were marked as potential bots
- User country was extracted from the location of their profile
- Tweets were marked as potential spam
- Hash-tags were extracted from the tweet text
- Product features were extracted from the tweet text
  + Display, Battery, Camera, Price, and 5G Capability

## Summary of Data 

<!--- SPEAKER NOTES- ALEX

  - This is a quick summary of our collected data:
  
    - Table 1 shows a summary of the collected tweet data grouped by product:
  
      - There were less tweets for the S20 than the S20 FE and iPhone 12 which is due to the constraints imposed by the Twitter API rate limits
      
      - 13-19% of the S20 FE and iPhone12 tweets were marked as spam, compared to the 3% for the S20
        - This is likely due to the tweets collected for the S20 being posted prior to the product release date

      - Only 7% of iPhone12 tweets contained mentions of the chosen features, compared to roughly 20% for the S20 and S20 FE
  
    - Table 2 shows a summary of the user data:
  
      - There were about 35,000 unique users, from 163 identified countries
    
      - Less than 1% of these users were marked as bots. The actual amount being 155 users
    
--->

```{r Overview of Data Extracted, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

total_tweets <- nrow(tweets)

tweets_summary <- tweets %>%
  group_by(product) %>%  # Group by product

            percent_spam = percent(length(which(potential_spam == T))/n_tweets),  # % spam tweets
            percent_features = percent(length(which(!is.na(mentioned_features)))/n_tweets)  # % of tweets with mentioned features
  ) %>%
  rename('Product' = product, 'Number of Tweets' = n_tweets,
         '% Spam Tweets' = percent_spam,'% Feature Tweets' = percent_features)

## Results - Sentiment Analysis - All Tweets

<!-- SPEAKER NOTES - Tania

  We decided to perform sentiment analysis for each model. 

  We used the 'sentimentr' package which calculates average sentiment for a group of sentences instead of individual words. This was more suitable for our analysis since each tweet consists of 1 or more whole sentences, on each feature, for each of the 3 products. This reduces skewed data, for example the phrase 'not so good' could be seen as positive instead of negative as not would be a stop word.

  The visualisation on this slide demonstrates the overall sentiment for each product. 

  The idea behind the release of the S20FE is that Samsung took their customer's feedback into consideration and implemented changes to features like display, price, battery. 
  
  This can be seen by the S20FE having a higher mean sentiment than the S20 and the iPhone.

-->

```{r include=FALSE}
# Calculate the mean sentiment for each product
mean_sentiment <- tweets %>% 
                            group_by(product) %>%
                            summarize(mean_sentiment = signif(mean(avg_sentiment), 6))  
```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5.5}
# Plot the distribution of sentiment for tweets for all models

## Results - Sentiment Analysis - Features

<!--- SPEAKER NOTES - Tania

  We then examined sentiment for the 5 most mentioned features which can be seen in boxplot on the slide.

  Each coloured box represents where the sentiment of the majority of tweets lay with the thick horizontal line across the inside of the boxes showing the average sentiment.

  Samsung's improvement of particular features, for which it gathered feedback from customers who purchased an S20 model, can be clearly seen from the visualisation.

  This can be seen by the sentiment for all the S20FE's features, except for camera, are higher than that of the S20, not mentioning that it's higher than that of the iphone12 in most features.

  This coincides with the improvements that the S20FE made over the original S20 in all but the camera where the camera spec was reduced for the S20FE.

## Results - Global Sentiment By Product

<!-- SPEAKER NOTES - Alex

  Performing the sentiment analysis globally based on regions produced three main findings:

    that our data set may be too small to cover the sentiment globally as evidenced by the white regions seen on the maps which indicates no data for that region

    where the colours are lighter, ie. negative sentiment, we may need to improve marketing and brand image
    
    where there are darker areas for competitors of a certain product i.e. higher positive sentiment, extra attention should be taken in those regions to improve brand awareness and public sentiment

## Statistical Test - T-Test

<!--- SPEAKER NOTES - Tania

  We can run the t-test when the groups of samples being compared, are normally distributed and when the variances of the groups 
  are equal.

  This can be checked using Shapiro-Wilk's test. The test should be performed on sentiment values for tweets related to each 
  model we're analysing, regardless of whether it's related to any feature or not.

  Since our data set is too large, over 5,000 entries, we performed an Anderson-Darling's test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test since 
  these test do not have an entry limitiation .
 
  P values for both tests were less then 0.05 which confirms numerically that our data is not normally distributed.

  This is demonstrated by the density plots seen on the slide.
  
  Hence, the t-test is not applicable with this data set.

## Conclusions

<!-- SPEAKER NOTES

  From our analysis we can draw the following conclusions:

    Historical twitter data can be used effectively to analyse the public opinions and sentiments about a particular topic. 
    
    Due to the nature of Twitter data being current, it is therefore possible for businesses to perform live analysis of the public's opinion around the release of a new product, to get instant feedback and determine its early success.

  ##Apple
  
    From Apple's persepctive we would recommend the following:

      The sentiment analsysis performed on all tweets shows that the extra development and improvements of the S20FE did lead to an increase in sentiment scores when compared to the S20. Thus, Apple would benefit from examining it customer's opinion to help it focus its development of the next iphone. 

      The iPhone has positive sentiment in all feature areas but was only marginally ahead of Samsung in the 5G connectivity. For battery, camera, display and price, the iPhone received lower sentiment scores. These areas need further investigation which may lead to a need for more R&D or targeted marketing from Apple to improve the sentiment scores.  

      The iPhone has a very positive sentiment in both Russia and America but is lacking in Australia, Canada and South America, which appear to have a higher sentiment towards Samsung. These location may be key for Apple to increase its sales by converting Samsung users.
  
  
  ##Samsung

    From Samsung's persepctive we would recommend the following:

      Listening to the fans to influence and direct the development and production of the S20FE has led to a more positive response than the S20.

      However the increased battery life of the S20FE did not increase the sentiment significantly. This means either a larger improvement of the battery is needed or less focus in the marketing can be made on battery life. 

      While the camera of the S20FE was recevied positively, it was significanyly lower than that of the S20 but more importantly the iPhone12. This is counteracted by the much higher sentiment in price but is an area we would recommend that Samsung try to improve through marketing and R&D.

      The global sentiment shows that Samsung has a fairly neutral if not negative sentiment in places like Russia and the US, where the iPhone is seen in a very positive way. Samsung should examine it's marketing and other factors to determine why sentiment is this way and see if it can improve the sentiment scores.

<!-- REMOVED SPEAKER NOTES

  The sentiment analsysis performed on all tweets shows that the extra development and improvements of the S20FE did lead to an increase in sentiments scores when compared to the S20 and iphone12.

  Individual feature sentiment analysis demonstrated that while the overall sentiment was higher for the S20FE there were some features where there was a physical change to the device but no noticeable increase in sentiment.
  This can be seen when examining the sentiment towards the battery where it has remained similar or the camera where the decreased physical performance over the S20 has led to a lower sentiment score.  

  The feature sentiment analysis can help identify areas were Apple and Samsung need to examine the perceived value of a feature and determine if a larger physical improvement to the device is needed or if it is useful to develop or change a different feature which may lead to a more improved sentiment. 

  The global sentiment analysis, which could be broken down into specific regions can help us to identify keys locations where the business can either improve brand awareness or brand perception.

-->

**General**

- Twitter data useful for sentiment analysis
- Live feedback on product releases

**Apple**

- Analysing customer responses can improve future product sentiment
- Positive in all features
- Only ahead with 5G connectivity
- Strong positive sentiment in Russian and America
- Negative or low sentiment in Australia, Canada and South America
- Feature R&D and targeted marketing required

**Samsung**

- Using customer opions to guide development was successful
- Battery improvements went almost unoticed 
- Camera change decreased sentiment
- Positive sentiment in South America and Africa
- Negative sentiment in Russia and American
- Examintation of areas where Apple is seen more positively

## Further Analysis

<!-- SPEAKER NOTES

  Some key areas for improvements and further research include:

    Utilising Google Maps API to have an improved region filter on the tweets so we could focus the collection of data

    Examination for example of how many time in a tweet about iPhones is another device or manufacture mentioned either positive or negatively.

    Determining the average income in relation to the sentiment by region would help us identify if this was a cause of lower sentiment

    An increase in the quantity of tweets would help expand the data set and hopefully include tweets to analyse for region that we had no info for.

    Additional analysis of the sentiment by feature along with the actual cost of the changes in device could identify better R&D decisions.

-->

- Google Maps API 
- Look at mentions of Apple in Samsung and vice versa
- Examination of average income and sentiment by region
- Increased number of tweets with more targeted dates before and after the release dates
- Sentiment by feature along with the actual cost of the changes

  ##STOCK PRICE VS SENTIMENT

    REASON FOR REMOVAL
      Needed to be cut to save time and slide numbers

    SPEAKER NOTES
      We wanted to determine if there was a correlation between the stock price and the current sentiment of the public's opinion on Twitter.
      We decided to use a regression analysis to determine this and see if we could predict future stock price based on the current sentiment.
